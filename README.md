# todoList

todoList is a school project where we had to create a todoList application holding in one page.

## Prerequisites
- PHP 5.6.31
- Wamp / Xampp

### Database
- Open PhpMyAdmin
- Create a new database named 'todolistdb'
- Go to SQL and import the sql file
- [!] Be careful, you may need to modify the SQL port in includes/config.php. The current SQL port is 3306.

## Features
- User account creation
- User account connection
- User account disconnection
- Task creation on the todoList (the tasks will be saved on your account and will still be here if you deconnect and reconnect)
- Task deletion
- Task validation (using a clickable color dot)

### Complications
- I had to create 2 others pages, for the account creation and login. Otherwise i had conflicts between the different forms.

## Test user 
**login:** yolo
**password:** yolo
